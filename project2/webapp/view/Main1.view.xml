    <Text id="_TDGenText" text="As a SAP student, I am a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate with a strong focus on SAP Sales and Distribution (SD), AI, and business process automation. I am currently working on building a SAP sd module for Olectra Buses, where I integrate production planning with procurement and sales to reflect real-world manufacturing flows. My technical foundation spans SQL, Java, Python, OOP, data science, and system design, complemented by hands-on experience in web development and form validation. I enjoy breaking down complex SAP and technical concepts into clear, actionable explanations, often creating reusable resources like cheat sheets and templates. With a keen interest in bridging technology and business value, I aim to deliver practical solutions that enhance efficiency and integration across modules such as MM, QM, and CO-PC, while continuously learning and applying SAP best practices.
